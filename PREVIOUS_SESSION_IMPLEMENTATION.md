# Previous Session Feature Implementation

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a feature to display exercise sets from the previous session on the exercise page. This allows users to reference their past workout data while logging new sets.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**File:** `routes/fitness_routes.py`
- Added a new API endpoint: `/api/previous_session/<exercise_name>`
- This endpoint fetches the most recent workout session for a specific exercise (excluding today)
- Returns structured data including:
  - Whether a previous session exists
  - Date of the previous session (formatted)
  - All sets from that session with set numbers, weights, and reps
  - Total number of sets

### 2. Frontend Template Updates
**File:** `templates/workout_entry.html`
- Added a new "Previous Session Card" section between the PR summary and Today's Sets
- The card includes:
  - A distinctive header with clock icon and "Previous Session" title
  - Date display showing when the previous session occurred
  - Table showing all sets from the previous session
  - Support for both regular and barbell exercises (with total weight display)

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
**File:** `static/workout_entry.js`
- Added `loadPreviousSession()` function that:
  - Fetches previous session data from the API
  - Populates the previous session table
  - Handles both barbell and regular exercises
  - Shows/hides the card based on whether previous session data exists
  - Integrates with the existing barbell weight calculation system
- Updated the initialization flow to load previous session data after exercise information is available

### 4. CSS Styling
**File:** `static/workout_entry.css`
- Added distinctive styling for the previous session card:
  - Light blue/purple gradient background
  - Colored top border to distinguish it from current session
  - Slightly transparent table for visual hierarchy
  - Consistent with the existing design system

## Features

### Visual Design
- The previous session card has a distinctive appearance with a gradient background and colored top border
- The date is prominently displayed in the card header
- The table maintains the same structure as the current session table but with reduced opacity for visual hierarchy

### Barbell Exercise Support
- For barbell exercises, the previous session table shows both the weight added and the total weight
- Automatically detects exercise equipment type and adjusts display accordingly
- Consistent with the existing barbell weight calculation system

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles cases where no previous session exists (hides the card)
- Includes error logging and fallback behavior
- Maintains application stability if API calls fail

### User Experience
- Loads automatically when the exercise page opens
- Updates when switching between exercises
- Provides immediate reference to past performance
- Non-intrusive design that complements existing functionality

## Usage
When a user navigates to an exercise page:
1. The system automatically checks for previous session data
2. If previous data exists, the "Previous Session" card appears above the "Today's Sets" section
3. Users can reference their previous weights and reps while logging new sets
4. The card remains visible throughout the workout session for easy reference

## Benefits
- **Improved Workout Planning**: Users can see their previous performance and plan progressive overload
- **Better User Experience**: No need to navigate away from the current page to check previous workouts
- **Visual Reference**: Clear, organized display of past session data
- **Consistency**: Maintains the same visual design language as the rest of the application
